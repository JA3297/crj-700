# The CRJ 700/900 Home Cockpit Project

## Description
The purpose of this project is to make open source plans to build a CRJ home cokpit with nothing but a 3d printer and electronic componenets. The hardware will aim to be compatible with CRJ products in MSFS 2020, FSX, P3D, and X-Plane!

## Support
I will have a discord up soon for contributions and discussion/support.

## Roadmap
I plan to start with the overhead. And once the overhead is built and functioning, I will move to the FMC. 
OVERHEAD -> FMC -> FCU -> MIP -> DISPLAY -> PEDESTAL -> FLIGHT CONTROLS -> ENCLOSURE -> RGB?

## Contributing
I am open to contributions as long as it is good favor of the project and matches the format of what is already existing (i.e. same font, compatibility with components, etc...)

## Project status
As a college student, its hard to find time to do anything other than school. Put on top of that, Im an aviation student, well, lets say I work on this on the weekend. I choose to have as much quality from what i make while still keeping everything affordable enough for the average person to make. If I, a college student, can afford it, you should be able to.
